"""
QualityScorer module for computing weighted data quality metrics.

This module evaluates different aspects of dataset quality using
EDA outputs, including:
- Missing value quality
- Duplicate row quality
- Outlier impact
- Balance score (placeholder)
It also computes a final weighted overall quality score.
